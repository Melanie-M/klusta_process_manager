To run another program instead of klusta, for example phy

1) In config / config.py:
     The method "get_klusta_path" should return the path to the program
     The current method look for the full path to klusta, because of virtual environment issue
     For phy, it should be enough to change the method to
         def get_klusta_path():
             return "phy"
     
             
2) In experiment / klustaFolder.py:
     The method "run_process" runs klusta on one folder
     "arguments" is a list of string arguments for klusta
     self.program is the string returned by "get_klusta_path"
     
     Example
     To run "phy cluster-auto params.prm", you need
        self.program == "phy"
        arguments == ["cluster-auto", "params.prm"]
