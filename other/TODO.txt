---------Global
# Check licence

--------Idea of new Features
# look by date instead of animal ?

# no database version / simpler folderview (other lab)

# Include OpenEphys stuff (script for below idea ?)

# remap process: launch any script/ list of instruction (rsync, then ...)

# update to phy

# prb creator

---------Main Window
# loading message if database too long - not needed ?


---------FileBrowser

# allow user to pick a folder's' color manually. How to save efficiently, not
  losing in reinstall ?

#keep list of animal done for color

---------ProcessManager --> might change a lot with phy
# better detect crash


---------Server
# check what happens is client leaves while data is processing
# give a name to client ? 
# send stuff when client reconnect
# kill to reimplement

---------database




try:
    x = my_dict["key"]
except KeyError:
    # handle missing key
