---------Global
# Add licence

# closeEvent

--------Idea of new Features
# simpler no database version 
# allow .dat not in local, only in backUP (beacause .dat take too much memory)
# look by date instead of animal

# Include OpenEphys stuff



---------Main Window
# loading message if database too long


---------FileBrowser
# filewatcher to check if color change
# check if folder root empty ?

# allow user to pick a folder's' color manually

# keep list of animal where colors are done (so no need to launch thread)

---------ProcessManager --> might change a lot with phy
# better detect crash
# rethink buttons, put some in a menu or rightclick

# keep a list of what is checked, remove experiment.isCheck


---------Server
# create separate app
# check what happens is client leaves while data is processing
# give a name to client ? 
# send stuff when client reconnect

---------database
# datetime is not flewible (use '_')



try:
    x = my_dict["key"]
except KeyError:
    # handle missing key
